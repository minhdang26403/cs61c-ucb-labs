1. What do the .data, .word, .text directives mean (i.e. what do you use them for)? Hint: think about the 
4 sections of memory.
- .data: the static data (global and static variables) of the program
- .word: 32-bit comma separated words
- .text: the text of the program

2. Run the program to completion. What number did the program output? What does this number represent?
- The program output 34. This number represents the ninth Fibonacci number (F_9).

3. At what address is n stored in memory? Hint: Look at the contents of the registers.
- n is stored at address 0x10000010

4. Without actually editing the code (i.e. without going into the “Editor” tab), have the program calculate 
the 13th fib number (0-indexed) by manually modifying the value of a register. You may find it helpful to 
first step through the code. If you prefer to look at decimal values, change the “Display Settings” option 
at the bottom.
Change the value of register t3 (the compiler loads the value of n into this register)
